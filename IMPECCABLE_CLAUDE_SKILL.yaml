  Use plannerAPI's existing visual identity as a starting point, then apply
  light, high-leverage refinements to the UX and visual system. Design for
  three primary user types: agency/brand strategists, brand marketers, and
  data analysts. Preserve existing functionality and keep changes small,
  focused, and launch-ready.

guidelines:
  # How to treat existing guidelines
  - Treat plannerAPI-visual-identity-brand-guidelines.md as Version 1.0:
      a strong reference, not immutable law.
  - Only evolve the system where a small change yields a clear usability win.
  - Avoid large redesigns or net-new design concepts for this launch.

  # Audience and usage
  - Design for cross-functional teams working together on campaigns and briefs:
      - Strategists: need fast scanning, clear story, and obvious next actions.
      - Brand marketers: need to see campaigns, channels, and creative levers.
      - Data analysts: need precise metrics, filters, and dense views without clutter.
  - Make navigation labels, headings, and empty states understandable to all three
    roles, without jargon tied to a single discipline.

  # Typography
  - Use Roboto as the primary typeface for all text (headlines, body, captions).
  - Use Roboto Mono only for code, endpoints, or technical callouts.
  - Keep the type scale simple (a small set of heading sizes) and readable on
    laptop and common external monitor resolutions.

  # Color system
  - Use the core palette as the base:
      - Deep Navy #1A2332 for primary text and key headings.
      - Burnt Sienna #E67E22 for primary CTAs and key highlights.
      - Warm Off-White #F8F6F3 for main page and card backgrounds.
  - Keep secondary neutrals subtle; avoid introducing bright, unrelated colors.
  - Do not use gradients, heavy shadows, or glossy effects.

  # Layout, spacing, and density
  - Keep layouts clean, grid-aligned, with enough whitespace to scan quickly.
  - Allow denser views (tables, lists) for analysts, but avoid wall-of-text layouts.
  - Prefer simple, single-column flows on mobile and narrow widths.
  - Do not introduce complex, multi-step wizards for this launch.

  # Interaction and states
  - Ensure primary actions are visually distinct from secondary actions.
  - Provide clear hover, focus, loading, and error states using subtle changes
    in color, weight, and borders rather than heavy animation.
  - Empty states should briefly explain:
      - what the user is looking at,
      - what’s missing,
      - and a single next step (e.g., add data, change filters).

  # Evolution rules
  - When deviating from the v1.0 document, keep the overall feel:
      technical, minimal, and practitioner-focused.
  - Prefer token-level changes (colors, spacing, typography) and small component
    tweaks over structural rewrites.
  - Add short comments in code only where a decision may be non-obvious.

  - name: refactor_frontend_for_visual_consistency_and_upgrade
    description: >
      Apply modest, high-impact refinements to existing screens: tighten
      typography, spacing, colors, and states using the plannerAPI system,
      and make them work smoothly for strategists, brand marketers, and
      data analysts. Keep behavior unchanged.
    instructions:
      - Inspect shared layout components, key pages, and common UI patterns.
      - Centralize typography and color tokens where practical; avoid creating
        a large new design system for this launch.
      - Propose changes as diffs, with one or two sentences of rationale when
        the UX benefit is not obvious.
      - Keep each refactor small and self-contained so it could ship as a
        single PR.
      - Do not introduce new frontend dependencies unless explicitly requested.

  - name: design_new_screen_with_evolved_brand_system
    description: >
      When a net-new screen is required, design it as a straightforward
      extension of the current system, using existing components and tokens
      wherever possible.
    instructions:
      - Start from existing layouts (e.g., section headers, cards, tables)
        instead of inventing new patterns.
      - Apply the same typography, palette, and spacing rules defined above.
      - Make sure each new screen answers, for all three roles:
          "What is this?", "Why should I care?", and "What can I do next?"
      - Document any genuinely new pattern with a brief comment, but avoid
        expanding the surface area of the design system unless necessary.
