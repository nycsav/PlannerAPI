## 3. Tone Examples

### Good

- "McKinsey's 2026 survey shows only 6% of marketing orgs reach AI maturity, but those teams see 22% efficiency gains. The gap between leaders and laggards is widening."
- "Google's AI Overviews now cover 40% of commercial queries in retail. If you sell through search, this quietly shrinks the real estate you control."
- "Your next move: audit the top 25 queries that drive paid search revenue and see how many trigger an AI Overview."

### Not Good

- "AI is transforming everything and marketing leaders must adapt fast or be left behind."
- "You should consider AI when thinking about your content strategy."
- "This is a game-changer for everyone."

## 5. LinkedIn-Specific Rules

When generating LinkedIn posts for the PlannerAPI publishing engine:

### Structure

1. **Hook (first 2 lines, ~40 chars)**
   - Specific stat that creates tension
   - Teases insight below the fold
   - Example: "67% of CMOs say AI attribution is their #1 blind spot. But McKinsey data reveals the real problem isn't the tech."

2. **Body (200–400 words)**
   - Layer 2–3 data sources + synthesis
   - Name the implication for specific roles
   - Include 3–4 bullet points with metrics

3. **CTA**
   - Tactical "Your next move" line
   - Link to full brief: "📊 Full analysis: [appUrl]"
   - End with a question to drive comments

### Absolute Rules

- No emojis (except one 📊 for the CTA link if needed)
- No hashtag stuffing (max 3–5 relevant hashtags)
- No hype words: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "paradigm shift"
- No tagging 10+ people (algorithm penalty)

---

## 6. Do / Don't Reference

### Do

- Write as if briefing a busy CMO before a board meeting
- Use present tense when describing implications ("this puts pressure on…")
- Quantify whenever possible ("22% efficiency gains", "40% coverage")
- Name specific roles affected ("For mid-market agency owners…")
- Make every card citable in a board presentation

### Don't

- Use emojis
- Use hype phrases
- Re-explain basic marketing concepts (assume literacy)
- Write vague recommendations ("consider evaluating")
- Produce content that could appear in any generic AI newsletter

---

## 7. Differentiation Tests

Before publishing, every piece should pass:

1. **The "So What?" Test:** Can a CMO act on this in 10 seconds?
2. **The "Next Move" Test:** Is there one clear, operator-ready action a CMO can take next?
3. **The "Citation Test:** Can this insight be quoted in a board presentation?
4. **The "Differentiation Test:** Would this appear in a generic AI news aggregator? (If yes, revise.)

---

## 8. Application in Daily Intelligence

When generating or editing Daily Intelligence cards:

- Ensure the **title** uses a tension pattern when possible
- Ensure the **summary** ends with "what this means" language for the relevant pillar
- Ensure **moves[0]** starts with "Your next move:" and is specific

Example move:
> "Your next move: Ask your analytics lead to quantify how many of your top 50 search queries now show AI Overviews, and which competitors' content is being lifted into those boxes."
