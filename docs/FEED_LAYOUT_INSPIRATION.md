# Feed Layout Inspiration

## Purpose

Capture UI/UX patterns and layout ideas from external sources that may influence future versions of Daily Intelligence, briefs, or playbook galleries.

This is a living document. Add screenshots, links, and notes as you find inspiration.

## Sources to Watch

- **Perplexity Discover:** https://www.perplexity.ai/discover
- **Morning Brew / Axios:** Newsletter card layouts
- **Executive briefing apps:** (add links as found)
- **Competitor feeds:** (add links as found)

---

## Patterns We Like

*(Add bullet points as you find them)*

- Example: "Perplexity Discover uses a 2-column masonry grid with source badges—consider for playbook gallery."
- Example: "Axios uses bold single-stat headers with 1-sentence context—matches our tension framing."

---

## Patterns to Avoid

*(Add bullet points as you find them)*

- Example: "Overly visual cards with stock photos—feels generic, not executive."
- Example: "Infinite scroll without clear sections—hard to scan."

## Next Steps

When ready to implement a new pattern:
1. Reference this doc in your Claude Code prompt.
2. Ask Claude to propose changes to `DailyIntelligence.tsx` or related components.
3. After testing, update `docs/EDITORIAL_VOICE.md` or the Skill if adopting permanently.
