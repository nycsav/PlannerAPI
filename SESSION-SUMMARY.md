# PlannerAPI Development Session Summary
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Session Duration:** Complete redesign and feature implementation
**Status:** All changes deployed to production

---

## Overview
This session focused on major UX improvements to the PlannerAPI landing page and Intelligence Brief experience, transforming it from a basic MVP into a polished, executive-focused strategic intelligence platform.

---

## 1. Search Input Consolidation

### Problem
- Two duplicate search inputs on the page (hero search + Executive Strategy Intelligence section)
- Confusing user experience - unclear which one to use
- Empty white space from unused chat section

### Solution
- **Removed duplicate input**: Executive Strategy Intelligence section now hidden until activated
- **Progressive disclosure**: Section only appears after first query from hero search
- **Unified flow**: All queries route through hero search → scroll to chat section → auto-submit
- **State management**: Added `isChatActive` flag to conditionally render chat wrapper

### Files Modified
- `components/ExecutiveStrategyChat.tsx`
- `App.tsx`

### Result
- Clean page load with single, focused CTA
- Better information hierarchy
- Eliminates user confusion

---

## 2. Grid Layout Fix

### Problem
- Intelligence Briefings cards had misaligned layout
- Grid math was incorrect (3+2=5 columns in 4-column grid)
- Cards appeared broken/mispositioned

### Solution
- **Fixed grid structure** (4-column layout):
  - **Rows 1-2**: Featured card (2×2 columns) + Cards 2-3 (2×1 each)
  - **Row 3**: Cards 4-5 (2×1 each)
  - **Row 4**: Card 6 (4×1 full width)

### Files Modified
- `App.tsx`

### Result
- Properly aligned card grid
- Professional, balanced layout
- Consistent spacing

---

## 3. Hero Headline Typewriter Animation

### Problem
- Static hero headline
- Missed opportunity to showcase multiple target audiences
- Lacked modern, engaging interaction

### Solution
- **Created TypewriterText component** with:
  - 5 rotating audience types (Marketing Leaders, Growth Teams, Agency Strategists, CX Executives, Brand Directors)
  - Typing speed: 50ms per character
  - Pause: 2 seconds after complete
  - Deleting speed: 30ms per character
  - Infinite loop with blinking cursor
  - Blue (bureau-signal) color maintained

### Files Created
- `components/TypewriterText.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `components/HeroSearch.tsx`

### Result
- Dynamic, attention-grabbing headline
- Showcases multi-audience value proposition
- Modern, polished interaction

---

## 4. Intelligence Brief Formatting Polish

### Problems Fixed
1. ❌ Duplicate sections (SUMMARY and SIGNALS showing same content twice)
2. ❌ Markdown not rendering (`**bold**` showing as raw text)
3. ❌ SIGNALS structured as dense paragraphs instead of bullets
4. ❌ Inconsistent hierarchy across sections

### Solution
**Created markdown parser utility** (`utils/markdown.tsx`):
- Handles `**bold**` syntax → `<strong>` tags
- `parseInlineMarkdown()` for inline text rendering
- Proper bullet point parsing and rendering

**Redesigned response structure**:
1. **SUMMARY**: Executive takeaway (2-3 sentences, no bullets)
2. **KEY SIGNALS**: Clean bulleted list with **bold headlines** + supporting details
3. **MOVES FOR LEADERS**: Actionable bullets with clear directives
4. **SOURCES**: Chip badges for all citations (clickable, numbered)
5. **CONTINUE EXPLORING**: Follow-up question input

### Files Created
- `utils/markdown.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `components/ExecutiveStrategyChat.tsx`

### Result
- Clean, scannable, executive-appropriate formatting
- Proper markdown rendering throughout
- No duplicate content
- Consistent visual hierarchy

---

## 5. Conversational Thread Experience

### Problem
- Intelligence Brief modal/sidebar needed to match inline quality
- No conversation history or threading capability
- Lacked Perplexity-style conversational UX

### Solution
**Built complete conversational thread experience**:

#### 1. Thread Layout
- Vertical conversation history (user query → AI response)
- Past responses collapse to headline + "Expand" button
- Most recent response fully expanded by default
- Smooth expand/collapse transitions

#### 2. Follow-Up Input (Sticky Bottom)
- Persistent input: "Ask a follow-up about this intelligence..."
- Sends query WITH full conversation context to API
- New responses append below, previous auto-collapse
- Context note: "Each follow-up includes context from the full conversation thread"

#### 3. Suggested Follow-Ups
- "CONTINUE EXPLORING" section with 3 contextual prompts
- Generated based on response content (ROI, AI, competitors, etc.)
- Navy outline, orange on hover (design system colors)
- Click auto-populates input and submits query

#### 4. Sources (Per Response)
- Source chips: [1] RTS Labs, [2] Miquido, etc.
- Clickable links open in new tab
- Numbered references match inline citations

#### 5. Conversation Actions
**Thread-level:**
- Export thread (downloads as .txt)
- Copy link (shares thread URL)
- Response counter (shows total responses)

**Per-response:**
- Copy response (formatted text)
- Regenerate (re-runs query)

### Files Created
- `components/ConversationalBrief.tsx` (529 lines)

### Files Modified
- `App.tsx` (replaced AISearchInterface with ConversationalBrief)

### Result
- Professional, Perplexity-quality conversational experience
- Full thread context awareness
- Bundle size reduced from 597KB → 252KB (58% smaller!)

---

## Design System Implementation

### Color Palette
- **Primary Dark**: `planner-navy` (#1B365D)
- **Accent/CTAs**: `planner-orange` (#FF6B35)
- **Links/Secondary**: `bureau-signal` (#2563EB)
- **Text**: `bureau-slate` (#475569)
- **Surface**: `bureau-surface` (#FFFFFF)
- **Borders**: `bureau-border` (#E2E8F0)

### Typography
- **Display**: Outfit (black weight, uppercase, NO italic)
- **Body**: Inter/Roboto (professional, readable)
- **Monospace**: Roboto Mono (technical elements)

### Design Principles Applied
1. **Signal Over Noise**: Removed duplicate UI, reduced clutter
2. **Clarity Before Cleverness**: Direct language, obvious CTAs
3. **Trust Through Precision**: Specific data, cited sources
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show features as users need them
5. **Consistent, Purposeful Motion**: Smooth transitions, intentional animations
